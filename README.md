# AIECAD â€” AIE Computer Aided Design

**AIECAD (AIE Computer Aided Design)** is an interactive **GUI-based design platform** that allows developers and performance engineers to visually construct and simulate **AMD AI Engine (AIE) / Ryzen AI NPU** programs using the [IRON](https://github.com/Xilinx/mlir-aie) framework.

Instead of hand-writing AIE Python or C++ code, users can **draw their designs on a grid**, connecting **tiles, memories, and shims** through directed edges that represent the **ObjectFifo** abstraction and then automatically generate executable IRON Python code.
